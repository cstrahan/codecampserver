        <a class="question" onclick="return Toggle('answer1')">1. What is NCoverExplorer?</a><br/>
        <div id="answer1" style="display:none">
			<p class="answer">This tool allows you to open a coverage.xml file produced by 
				<a href="http://www.ncover.com/">NCover</a> and navigate the source code. The 
				source code is highlighted to clearly show which statements were visited
				and not visited. You can filter, sort and report on the coverage results.
			</p>
		</div>
        <a class="question" onclick="return Toggle('answer2')">2. What versions of the .NET Framework does it work with?</a><br/>
        <div id="answer2" style="display:none">
			<p class="answer">As of version 1.3.4 NCoverExplorer requires either .NET 1.1 or .Net 2.0 (version 2.0.1 is compiled
			against .Net 2.0).
			</p>
        </div>
        <a class="question" onclick="return Toggle('answer3')">3. What versions of NCover does it work with?</a><br/>
        <div id="answer3" style="display:none">
			<p class="answer">NCoverExplorer has been tested with NCover 2.0.1. Running versions of NCover prior to 2.0.1 is
			supported but not recommended.
			</p>
        </div>
        <a class="question" onclick="return Toggle('answer4')">4. Can I integrate it with my Visual Studio.Net version XXX IDE?</a><br/>
        <div id="answer4" style="display:none">
			<p class="answer">Jamie Cansdale now offers a "Test with... Coverage" feature
				in the latest version of his excellent <a href="http://www.testdriven.net/">TestDriven.Net</a>
				tool. This will automatically launch NCoverExplorer to display the results
				of running unit test(s) under code coverage with NCover. Note that as of build 1341
				TestDriven.Net now works using both the latest version of NCover (2.0.1) and the earlier NCover 1.3.3 version.
			</p>
 		</div>
        <a class="question" onclick="return Toggle('answer5')">5. Can I integrate it without TestDriven.Net?</a><br/>
        <div id="answer5" style="display:none">
			<p class="answer">The solution I used at work was a combination of NAnt and NAntRunner 
				(the VS.Net add-in) to perform something similar. I have NAnt tasks to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Perform the build.
					</li>
					<li>
						Execute NCover while running unit tests (either all unit tests or those for
						a specific fixture using the /fixture feature of <a href="http://nunit.org/">NUnit</a>).
					</li>
					<li>
						Launch NCoverExplorer displaying the output coverage.xml file.
					</li>
				</ul>
 			<p class="answer">NCoverExplorer 1.3.5 and later include a GUI to run NCover directly
			from within NCoverExplorer and display the results.
			</p>
		</div>
        <a class="question" onclick="return Toggle('answer6')">6. How does it compare to Visual Studio Team System?</a><br/>
		<div id="answer6" style="display:none">
			<p class="answer">VSTS features of unit testing and code coverage will only be included with the premium bundles
				of the Visual Studio product range - and as such will most likely be priced above what many
				developers and businesses are prepared to pay. For "everyone else" in the market it would seem likely
				that they will continue to utilise other alternatives.
			</p>
			<p class="answer">Even if you are one of the fortunate developers who can afford VSTS, it still must
				be measured feature-wise against the other alternatives which in a lot of cases have now been established
				for many years. Developers and managers will weigh up for themselves how important those features are
				as well as other factors such as Microsoft support etc. The nice thing for many of us is that we have a choice...
			</p>
 			<p class="answer">We have had a number of people e-mail us and say they prefer TestDriven.Net and NCoverExplorer
 				over the VSTS alternative and want to switch off the VSTS ability - that's rather gratifying from our perspective!
			</p>
 		</div>
        <a class="question" onclick="return Toggle('answer7')">7. Why didn't you integrate NCoverExplorer directly into the IDE like VSTS or SharpDevelop?</a><br/>
		<div id="answer7" style="display:none">
			<p class="answer">A number of reasons. At first glance having your code colour coded within the VS.Net IDE may sound
				great. However think about what we are trying to achieve - improving our <b>test</b> code to increase our coverage.
				That means in many cases you want to be editing the unit tests themselves, not the pretty coloured code under test.
				This then requires either a photographic memory or a penchant for continually resizing your IDE/tab groups, as well as an ability
				to not find the colours distracting while editing and refactoring code... not my first choice.
			</p>
			<p class="answer">You may instead find it more convenient to have a separate application window which can be positioned 
				on a second screen (you all have at least two don't you?) or ALT-Tab switched between. As of release 1.3.1 
				NCoverExplorer allows direct code navigation from method coverage in NCoverExplorer to it's corresponding line 
				in the source code file within the VS.Net IDE.
			</p>
			<p class="answer">From a technical perspective an add-in is a non-trivial task - particularly if trying to support all 
				the variants of the VS.Net IDE. To do it natively requires VSIP skills which is a trip to the dark side. 
				I won't say "never" however and	if I find some spare time (or you want to volunteer to help me!) then it might 
				happen one day...
			</p>
 		</div>
        <a class="question" onclick="return Toggle('answer8')">8. What do the tree node colours mean?</a><br/>
		<div id="answer8" style="display:none">
			<p class="answer">The default settings when NCoverExplorer is installed are as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<span class="treeviewGrey">Grey text</span> - the namespace/class/method has zero coverage. (Icon will be greyed also)
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="treeviewRed">Red text</span> - the namespace/class/method has partial coverage.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="treeviewBlue">Blue text</span> - the namespace/class/method coverage has partial coverage exceeding a satisfaction threshold (default 95%).
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="treeviewBlack">Black text</span> - the namespace/class/method has 100% coverage.
					</li>
				</ul>
 		</div>
        <a class="question" onclick="return Toggle('answer9')">9. What do the source code highlighting colours mean?</a><br/>
		<div id="answer9" style="display:none">
			<p class="answer">The default settings when NCoverExplorer is installed are as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<span class="sourceBlue">Blue background</span>  - this section of code was visited (a tooltip tells you how many times).
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="sourceRed">Red background</span>  - this section of code was not visited.
					</li>
				</ul>
				You can change these settings in the View->Options dialog. For instance you may prefer to underline the unvisited code.
 		</div>
        <a class="question" onclick="return Toggle('answer10')">10. What is that "Satisfaction Threshold" all about?</a><br/>
		<div id="answer10" style="display:none">
			<p class="answer">Depending on your coverage strategy, the code being tested and the extent of your usage of reflection,
				mock objects and/or dependency injection you may determine it unfeasible to try
				to reach 100% coverage everywhere. Some teams readily accept the diminishing returns
				that can apply and instead set a specific blanket coverage goal such as “85%”.
			</p>
			<p class="answer">Assuming you have such a situation and there was no threshold capability, 
				you would be stuck forever looking at a "danger red" node in the tree every time you open NCoverExplorer. 
				With this feature enabled (by setting a threshold less than 100% in the View->Options dialog) you see 
				a more calming mellow “blue” instead...
			</p>
			<p class="answer">As of release 1.3.1 you can now also specify the tolerance as a number of unvisited lines.
				If either of the two threshold conditions are met the node will be coloured appropriately. Note that
				a visit count of zero will always show as uncovered regardless of your tolerance.
			</p>
			<p class="answer">Of course just because you exceed the percentage doesn't mean that the 5% of code unvisited 
				isn't the most critical!
			</p>
		</div>
        <a class="question" onclick="return Toggle('answer11')">11. I have a killer idea for XYZ feature - can you add it for me?</a><br/>
        <div id="answer11" style="display:none">
			<p class="answer">Please send us a support ticket <a href="http://www.ncover.com/ticket">here</a>. We are always ready to
			listen to and thoughtfully consider ideas from the community.

        <a class="question" onclick="return Toggle('answer13')">13. What are the keyboard shortcuts?</a><br/>
